# Simple-ImageClassification-using-Pytorch

**Luuk van Waveren - April 2023**

Machinelearning is a hot topic. As an introduction to machinelearning i made a neural network during my college education in 2019.

This is my python implemention using pytorch that learns to performs simple image classification using an image set from Caltech Data.

The program uses the images to create a dataset, starts learning to correctly classify as to what each image is and shows how good it does this at the end.
